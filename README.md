# Hypothyroidism detector model

## Context:
Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients.

Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is not able to produce enough thyroid hormone. Since the main purpose of thyroid hormone is to "run the body's metabolism," it is understandable that people with this condition will have symptoms associated with a slow metabolism.

Hypothyroidism's deficiency of thyroid hormones can disrupt such things as heart rate, body temperature and all aspects of metabolism. Hypothyroidism is most prevalent in older women.

Major symptoms include fatigue, cold sensitivity, constipation, dry skin and unexplained weight gain.

Treatment consists of thyroid hormone replacement.

We are to build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

## Metric for success:
Our model should achieve a 75% to 80% accuracy rate to be viable as a first-stage analytics model. It can be refined further to improve accuracy.

## Results and conclusion:
We SMASHED the target accuracy level. We achieved 99% accuracy with this model
